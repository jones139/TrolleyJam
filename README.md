An attempt at a model of a supermarket using the Vadere pedestrian simulation
tool.
The idea is to see if we can come up with an optimum way of achieving social 
distancing and maximising throughput to reduce queues.

To do this we need to 
- Generate different types of shoppers - those that go through the shop sequentially, those that follow the order of their shopping list, and those that are a bit indecisive and go backwards and forwards a bit.   We would also like to have some slow ones to see the effect they have.
- Once we have a model that looks sensible, look at different strategies to 
optimise throughput while maintaining separation between shoppers.
